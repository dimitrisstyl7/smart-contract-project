## Description
This project involves the development of a Voting Smart Contract using Solidity on the Ethereum blockchain. 
The smart contract allows users to create polls, cast votes, and view results in a transparent and secure manner. 
It aims to enhance the voting process within communities and organizations, ensuring that all votes are recorded immutably on the blockchain.

## Features
- **Create New Poll**: Users can create a new poll with a specific question.
- **Vote on Poll**: Users can cast their votes (Yes/No) for a designated poll.
- **Close Poll**: The ability to manually close a poll to prevent further voting.
- **View Results**: Retrieve and display the results of a poll.
- **Single Vote Per User**: Each user can vote only once per poll, ensuring fairness.
